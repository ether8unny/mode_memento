memento the game
    Player Module: This module will manage player data, including their current location (room), their inventory, and their status (alive or dead).

    Room Module: This module will manage the game's rooms, including their creation, the items within them, and the players currently in them.

    Game Master Module: This module will contain the AI that observes player actions, determines outcomes, and manages the overall state of the game.

    Action Module: This module will manage the actions that players can take, including moving between rooms, interacting with items, and interacting with other players.

    Interaction Module: This module will handle communication between players and the game, including receiving player actions and sending game updates.

    GUI Module: This module will manage the game's graphical user interface, allowing players to see the current state of the game and input their actions.

Before we start creating these modules, I have a few questions to better understand your vision for the game:

    How should player death be handled? Once a player dies, can they rejoin the game or are they out permanently?

    Can you give an example of the types of actions a player can take and how you'd like the AI to determine the outcome?

    How do you envision the AI constraining the playing areas? What criteria should it use to decide when and where to limit the number of connected rooms?

    What kind of interactions are players allowed to have with items and other players?

    How detailed do you want the GUI to be? Do you want it to simply display text, or would you like more advanced features like an interactive map?
